# AI_PROMPTS.md

This document discloses the limited use of AI tools during the development of this project, in accordance with the assessment’s AI Usage Policy.

---

## AI Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

---

## Scope of AI Usage

AI assistance was used **sparingly** as a lightweight reference tool.  
The core implementation, logic, and design decisions were authored independently by the developer.

AI was primarily used to:
- Sanity-check Pyodide usage patterns (e.g., package loading)
- Clarify JavaScript ↔ Python data passing concepts
- Review documentation for completeness against the assignment requirements

AI was **not** used to generate the full solution or automate development.

---

## Representative Prompt Examples

The following examples illustrate the *type* of questions asked, not their frequency:

- “What is the recommended way to load Pillow in recent Pyodide versions?”
- “How can binary image data be safely passed between JavaScript and Python in Pyodide?”
- “Does this README sufficiently explain the design choices requested in the assignment?”

---

## Disclosure Statement

AI tools were used responsibly as a secondary aid for clarification and review.  
All final code and documentation reflect the developer’s own understanding and ownership.
